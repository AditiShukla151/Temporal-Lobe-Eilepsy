# Seizure Onset Detection in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy

This repository contains the code and documentation for a predictive model developed to detect seizure onset in patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. The project leverages multimodal EEG and MRI data to achieve high accuracy and enhance clinical outcomes.

## Overview

- **Objective**: To improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce diagnostic time for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Achieved 85% prediction accuracy.
  - Enhanced diagnosis accuracy by 20%.
  - Reduced diagnostic time by 30%.

## Features

1. **Predictive Model**:
   - Utilized multimodal EEG and MRI data for seizure onset detection.
   - Implemented advanced machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.

2. **Data Management**:
   - Patient records were stored and managed using SQL for efficient data handling and preprocessing.

3. **Deployment**:
   - The model was deployed on Azure for real-time monitoring.
   - Integrated predictive analytics with Azure DevOps pipelines for continuous deployment.

4. **Interactive Visualization**:
   - Created Power BI dashboards for real-time monitoring and decision-making support.
   - Improved clinical decision-making by 30%.
